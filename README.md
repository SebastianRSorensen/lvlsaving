## Task description
I decided to make a fullstack application where you can sign up, add saving goals, and chat to a chatbot about how you can reach your goals. You can also make transfers on your account, however, there is currently no tracking of how much you can deposit since this was not my main focus. In the real world it would be linked to your personal account which would stop you from beeing able to deposit more than you have.

## How to run
Enter https://www.funsavings.no to test out the application in your web browser. 

## Comments
I have used planetscale to host the database, prisma and trpc for backend communication, Kinde as authenticator, and Vercel to deploy the application.
